# Shell Chair Product Page Design (HTML & CSS Project)

## Overview

This project involves creating a Shell Chair Product Page using HTML and CSS. The page design mimics a professional furniture website, aiming to replicate the provided visual design as closely as possible. It showcases a high-quality chair, emphasizing an attractive layout, responsive design, and modern UI elements.

## Screenshot:

A screenshot of the provided design is attached to this repository. The design displays a product page featuring the Shell Chair with its description, price, and different color options.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to practice HTML and CSS skills by developing a static webpage that closely follows the provided design. The page should be responsive, visually appealing, and fully functional.

## Key Features
* Responsive Header and Navigation Bar:
* The header includes a company logo ("Carl Hansen & Søn") and a navigation bar with links to different sections: About, News, and Collection.
* The header also contains icons for user cart, wishlist, and a hamburger menu for smaller screen sizes.
* Product Display Section:
* The chair is showcased prominently in the center of the page, with a focus on a modern and minimalist design.
* The right-hand side features product details such as the name (Shell Chair), a brief description, price, and color swatches for selection.
* An “Add to Bag” button is provided, with an additional option to save the item to a wishlist.

## Color Options:

Color swatches representing different chair fabric colors are displayed beneath the product name. These swatches allow the user to visualize various color choices for the chair.

## Price Section:

The price of the chair ($735) is displayed in bold to make it prominent and easily noticeable.
Footer Section:

Social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are displayed on the left side of the footer.
A list of product details (e.g., “Aiku Soft with new luxury finishes”) is aligned at the bottom, functioning as a navigation panel for additional products.

## Design Highlights:

* Bright orange background for the product description section to create a contrast with the white and gray areas.
* Modern fonts, smooth shadows, and flat UI elements give a clean and elegant appearance to the product page.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5: For structuring the webpage.
* CSS3: For styling the page, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.

## HTML Code Structure

The project follows semantic HTML to ensure readability and good structure:

* Header: Contains the logo, navigation links, and cart/wishlist icons.
* Main Section: Displays the chair product image, name, description, price, and "Add to Bag" button.
* Footer: Includes social media links and additional product suggestions.
* CSS Code Breakdown
* Reset Styles: A basic CSS reset is applied to remove browser default styles.
* Typography: Fonts are chosen to match the modern, minimal aesthetic of the design.
* Layout: Flexbox and grid systems are used to position elements.
* Colors: The color scheme uses a bold orange, with neutral tones like white, gray, and black for contrast.
* Hover Effects: Button and color swatch interactions are enhanced with subtle hover effects to improve user experience.

## Challenges and Learning Experience
*  Positioning Elements: One of the challenges was precisely positioning the chair image and description to match the original layout. * This required experimenting with CSS Flexbox and Grid.
* Responsive Design: Ensuring that the page adapts to different screen sizes, especially the navigation and product details, was a key part of the learning process. Media queries were implemented to make the design mobile-friendly.
* Color Matching: Selecting colors to closely match the provided design required attention to detail, particularly for the orange background and color swatches.

## Future Improvements

* JavaScript Functionality: As a future enhancement, JavaScript could be added to handle interactivity, such as adding products to a cart, color change on swatch click, or opening the hamburger menu.
* Accessibility: Further accessibility improvements, such as adding ARIA labels and ensuring keyboard navigability.
* Animation: Adding subtle animations (e.g., for hover effects or transitions) to improve the user experience.


This project was a great opportunity to practice building a static webpage with HTML and CSS, mimicking a professional design. The skills learned in this process, such as responsive layout techniques and working with color schemes, are invaluable for future projects.
